"The Bionis has awoken, and the Telethia are threatening the world. This is a secret episode that decides the future of Fiora, who has taken the Monado of Meyneth, as well as the rest of her companions.","The world of the Bionis--it is a land that spreads across the vast corpse of a humongous god. Along the leg of this god a colony has been built--one of the last ones in existence--Colony 9. The home and one of the few refuges left for the steadily decreasing Homs people. It is said, once long ago, there were ten full colonies. They fell to the Machine God’s armies sometime in the distance past, to be all but forgotten.
Colony 9 has survived longer than the others because of its one advantage: its great distance from the world of the Mechonis. Colony 9 was able to live peacefully despite the attacks happening above them. For those living in Colony 9, this is a home that could never be replaced.","“Shulk! Shulk... um. You got a minute?” Dean asked. He was a researcher who was ten years Shulk’s senior. Shulk had been working on his project at the military research center on Colony 9 when Dean had decided, as always, that he needed Shulk’s advice. He always needed advice. There was some widow he was half in love with, that seemed to be all he thought about. Despite Shulk’s long absence, he returned to find Dean to be the exact same as he had left him. Not that I really know anything about this sort of thing myself... Shulk thought with a sigh.
Dean was in the middle of saying something, and with a start Shulk realized that he hadn’t been paying attention. Not that Dean seemed to notice. He just went on about his problems as usual. Shulk liked him, and he was a senior researcher, so he decided to help him as best he could.
“... I’ll do what I can.”
It was such a small thing that he wanted. Shulk had already been through caves filled with monsters, to the head of the Bionis and back several times, what was all that to this? It was nothing at all to help him get what he wanted.
“I’m glad I could help you. Need anything else?”
Dean shook his head, smiling. He was such a serious person, never making jokes like the other people Shulk knew. But he was a person with a good heart.
Climbing the stairs of the research center, Shulk walked out into the Military District plaza. It was already evening. Another day had gone by and he hadn’t found a hint of what he was looking for. Not because of Dean’s little request, that had nothing to do with it. It would be easier to capture a dream upon waking then find what he hoped to find. Though I don’t think Linada is wrong, he thought. He cut across the plaza, his thoughts hazy and muddled.
It was just that time of evening when those who worked during the day were rushing home, and the soldiers on watch at night were heading out to their posts. The feelings is brought up felt so familiar, Shulk felt he had wandered back into the past.
The war against the Mechonis’ army had been occurring since time before history. It wasn’t too long ago that Colony 9 was nothing but a base of operations, somewhere they could return to. All the action would happen along the Sword Plains. When the Mechonis soldiers attacked, they would head out to meet them. On occasion, it is said, the Mechonis soldiers even made it as far as the Gaur Plains. But never, ever, had they reached Colony 9.
Such peace could have never been forever.
They had a year of peace after the last attack. One full year, before Colony 6 fell to the swarms of mechon. Those machines continued on, nearly taking their own colony. Except for...
That had been the start of their journey.
Now Colony 9 was preparing for the battle against the Telethia. Their great wings tear the sky, attack before you can even draw your sword. Their entire existence was to serve the Bionis. To reap the lives that live on that world. There was no where to run, no where to hide.
Day and night they readied themselves for battle. But, life continued on as always in the colony. It wasn’t the same peaceful life they had led before, but no longer would they allow themselves to be ruled by fear. Everyone’s changing... they’ve had to become so much stronger. Shulk thought to himself, watching the people pass by.
They all had to change, strengthening their minds and their bodies. And their hearts. Tension still vibrated through the air, but life continued on as usual.
It was one less thing Shulk had to worry about.
Soon they would be heading to the inside of the Bionis, to meet the god head on. There would be no escape. They would either win or die. They had decided, then, to leave behind no regrets. To do what they had to do, before they met their final fate.
Shulk needed to give the information he had gathered on his journey to his fellow researchers in the colony. The people who had lived on Mechonis, the Machina, had technology they had never seen before: The Monad Replica. If the Homs had that, it would give their armies incredible power.
Dean had been pleasantly surprised, and had gladly began researching the data Shulk had brought him (his expertise had not always been in cabbage rolls.)
There was just one thing left. One more thing that Shulk had to do. A small hope for the future that the Machina doctor Linada had given him. It was only a slim chance, but he desperately wanted it to come true. This was something different from the Monad Replica, something he hadn’t told anyone about...
Passing through the Central Plaza, Shulk headed towards the Residential District. He saw the artist Kenny Rohan and waved a greeting, but Kenny seemed not to see him. Sesame had a sleepy look to him, and didn’t seem to recognize him. The shops that opened at night were already open, as Shulk walked nearer to the entrance of the colony. Near the bridge that opened out into the wild lands, was Dunban and Fiora’s home. Dunban had chosen that spot so he could be first on the front lines when the enemy struck. Shulk put his hand on the door, and smiled. He had been here so often since he was a child, it was like another home to him. Looking at the bright lights shining out through the windows, he went inside."
